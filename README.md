# kNN
This is a simple application that implements a simple "k-nearest neighbours" algroithm to classify objects with numerical attributes and nominal decision attribute

How To Use:

1.Compile Main class with next args:
  1.Path to file with training data
  2.Path to file with test data
2.Next you should choose a number of nearest neighbours that programm should find out to classify objects
3.After that you will see the number of successfull classifies of objects from test data file and also percent of successes
4.You can enter arbitrary(with same dimension of vector) vector of attributes and program will classify your object
